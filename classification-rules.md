# Distribution Classification Rules (v0.1)

These rules are heuristic and observational.
They are designed to be adjusted over time.

---

## GREEN — Expanded Distribution
- Impressions increase rapidly between 5 → 15 → 30 minutes
- Early velocity accelerates
- Engagement ratio is stable or increasing

Interpretation:
The algorithm is testing the post with a wider audience.

---

## YELLOW — Local Distribution
- Impressions increase slowly but steadily
- Early velocity is flat
- Engagement is mostly from followers or replies

Interpretation:
The post is held within the local network.

---

## RED — Suppressed or Deprioritized
- Impressions stall early
- Little or no growth after 15 minutes
- Engagement is low or drops quickly

Interpretation:
The post was filtered or not promoted.

## Notes
Classification is probabilistic, not absolute.
Use control posts to detect system-wide changes.
